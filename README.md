# Introducing Not Perish, an innovative new Android application that is designed to promote food sustainability and reduce global food waste and hunger. Developed using Java and Android Studio, this application was built during a national level hackathon named CodeBreak 3.0, which was organized by MIT-ADT Pune. Our team of four, of which I am the team leader, won a cash prize of around 50000 Indian Rupees for this application.

One of the key features of Not Perish is its use of Google OCR technique to scan the text from grocery lists and make entries in the application regarding the expiry date and other details of each item. Users can easily scan the barcode of their grocery items to automatically enter the details into the app. Additionally, users can also add items manually, making it easy to keep track of all the food items in their pantry. As the expiry date approaches, the app sends notifications to remind users to consume the items before they expire, thereby reducing food wastage.

We also connected various NGOs with the app, so that users can donate their extra food to people in need and help reduce global hunger. Users can list food items on a global map, and NGOs or people in need can contact them or chat with them using the inbuilt chat system. This feature not only helps to reduce food waste but also helps to connect people in need with those who can help, making it a socially responsible application.

Furthermore, Not Perish incorporates ML/AI to create and show various recipes that can be used to utilize all the remaining food items or the items which are going to expire soon by simply selecting the food items from the application inventory. This feature not only helps to reduce food waste but also helps users to be more creative in their cooking, and to make the most of the food they have on hand. The app's inbuilt recipe feature suggests recipes based on the ingredients you already have, this way you can plan your meals and save food from getting wasted.

The app also has a feature of shopping list, where you can make a list of items you need to buy and it will remind you when you go to the grocery store next. This will help you to avoid buying unnecessary items and thereby, reducing food waste.
